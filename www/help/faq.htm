<p><i>Q. What is the kX Project?</i></p>
<p>A. The kX Project is a totally independent development project whose aim is to provide WDM Audio Drivers for newer operating systems for kX-Compatible audio cards. The kX Project is led by Eugene Gavrilov, Max Mikhailov and Hanz Petrov (full list of contributors <!-- <? echo("--"); echo(">"); klink("credits"); echo("<!--"); ?>-->here</a>).</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q2>
<p><i>Q. Is the kX Driver FREE?</i></p>
<p>A. Yes, the kX Driver is FREE and will remain FREE. However, you can support the development effort by donating to the <!-- <? echo("--"); echo(">"); klink("fund"); echo("<!--"); ?>-->kX Fund</a>.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q3>
<p><i>Q. How do I install the kX driver under <strike>Windows 2000,</strike> Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7?</i></p>
<p>A. <strike>Windows 2000, </strike> Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows 7 provide their own certified drivers for some EMU10kX-based audio cards. Our kX Audio Driver has not been certified by Microsoft (WHQL-ed) and thus a special installation procedure might be required. It is recommended that you first try running kXSetup, and if that fails, follow our <!-- <? echo("--"); echo(">"); klink("xp"); echo("<!--"); ?>-->Windows XP installation guide</a>.
      Windows 7 is not officially supported yet [April'2009].
</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q4>
<p><i>Q. Will there be GSIF support?</i></p>
<p>A. GSIF is supported since 3533 release.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q5>
<p><i>Q. Why am I experiencing serious CPU load when I use kX ASIO driver under Logic?</i></p>
<p>A. You should try disabling unused kX ASIO inputs and outputs. Logic opens all 16 inputs and 16 outputs by default.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q6>
<p><i>Q. Why are the Front and Rear outputs swapped by default?</i></p>
<p>A. Refer to the <!-- <? echo("--"); echo(">"); klink("rear"); echo("<!--"); ?>-->Front and Rear outputs explanation</a> for details.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q7>
<p><i>Q. Why do I experience clicks and data corruption while copying / burning CDs? I have a VIA 686B Southbridge chipset.</i></p>

<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q8>
<p><i>Q. Why does Windows tell me that I am missing required DLLs when I try to install the kX driver?</i></p>
<p>A. The kX Mixer and kX Setup are statically linked to certain Windows DLLs, which may or may not be found on every system. You can download the required files from the <!-- <? echo("--"); echo(">"); klink("down"); echo("<!--"); ?>--> kX Download</a> page if they are not present on your system.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q9>
<p><i>Q. How can I uninstall kX drivers? </i></u></p>
<p>A. Execute: Start Menu - Programs - kX Project - Uninstall or Re-install kX Audio Driver (Version xxxx) - and click 'Remove'. After the driver is removed, uninstall kX Project installation files by choosing 'Uninstall kX Project Package (Version xxxx)'</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q10>

<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q16>
<p><i>Q. Will there be support for the Creative Labs Extigy and Audigy2 NX?</i></p>
<p>A. The Extigy and Audigy2 NX cards are NOT 10k1/10k2-based card (most of their functionallity 
is software-based), and since they are USB audio devices they are not kX-compatible.
However, we are currently working on ASIO drivers for these cards. In order to finish 
we will need test samples -- please <!-- <? echo("--"); echo(">"); klink("fund"); echo("<!--"); ?>-->donate</a> to our kX Fund in order
to help us to support both cards.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q17>
<p><i>Q. Under which Operating Systems can I use the kX driver?</i></p>
<p>A. The kX driver conforms to the WDM (Windows Driver Model) specification and is therefore 
      compatible with the following Microsoft Windows operating systems: 
      Windows XP, <strike>Windows 2000, Windows 98 (Second Edition only), and Windows Me</strike>. 
      Windows Server 2003, Vista, Vista x64, Windows XP x64, Windows 7, Windows 7 x64 are supported. 
      Windows 98 (First Edition) will not be supported since it has no built-in support for WDM drivers (v1.1 or later).<br>
      Mac OS X version is available on our support forums.
      </p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q18>
<p><i>Q. Why should I use the kX driver and not the drivers that came with my soundcard? What are the advantages of the kX Audio Driver?</i></p>
<p>A. The kX driver may or may not suit your own particular needs, although you have little to lose by giving it a try. The kX driver is part of an independent development project, and already offers most if not all of the same features included in the original manufacturers' drivers. In fact, the kX driver set is continually being updated and improved, with frequent driver and supporting application releases.</p>

<a name=Q18>
<p><i>Q. Are the kX drivers aimed at musicians or gamers or both?</i></p>
<p>A. At present the kX driver is aimed primarily at musicians, and especially those who wish to get the most out of their soundcards (and who have traditionally been left behind by the big soundcard manufacturers, who prefer to concentrate their efforts on the more lucrative gamers market). Features designed specifically for gamers will however be added as development of the drivers continues.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q19>
<p><i>Q. Does the kX driver have ASIO support? ASIOv2?</i></p>
<p>A. ASIO v2.0 - based hosts are fully supported, however, some ASIO2 features are 
not implemented due to hardware limitations. 24-bit ASIO support is planned for 10k2-based boards.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q20>
<p><i>Q. What kind of latency can I expect to see?</i></p>
<p>A. The minimum expected ASIO latency is expected to be 5.33 ms (and possibly as low as 2.66 ms, depending on your hardware/software setup).</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q21>
<p><i>Q. Will I get low latency with Cakewalk's Sonar?</i></p>
<p>A. The kX driver is a kernel-streaming WDM driver, and a latency as low as 10 ms can be expected under Sonar (depending on your hardware/software setup).</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q22>
<p><i>Q. Does the kX driver incorporate DirectX support?</i></p>
<p>A. Currently, DirectSound2D and DirectSound3D are fully supported. 
DirectSound3D support is under constant development, however it can cause issues with some games.
Any offers to help with implementing support for DirectSound3D would be gladly accepted (skilled programmers only please!).</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q23>
<p><i>Q. Does the kX driver support multiple soundcards? How many?</i></p>
<p>A. Multiple soundcards are indeed supported by the kX driver. In theory, an unlimited number of soundcards could be used at once, but in reality you're likely to be limited by the number of PCI slots in your machine. Any combination of EMU10k1 and/or EMU10k2-based cards can be used with the kX driver (together with soundcards by other manufacturers, running their own drivers), provided the BIOS and the OS recognize the cards and assign the resources correctly.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->


<a name=Q24>
<p><i>Q. Can I use SoundFonts with the kX driver?</i></p>
<p>A. Yes, your soundcard will continue to function as a SoundFont-compatible device under the kX driver. SoundFonts can be loaded and unloaded via SoundFont-aware applications, or via the kX Mixer's SoundFont control page. Currently only SF2 files are supported, however SF1 (SBK) files can be converted to SF2 files using a freely available utility.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->


<a name=Q25>
<p><i>Q. Is there a SoundFont control panel included with the kX driver set?</i></p>
<p>A. Yes, the kX Mixer includes a SoundFont control panel, which allows loading and unloading of SoundFonts to compatible soundcards running under the kX drivers.</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<a name=Q26>
<p><i>Q. Can I use the Vienna SoundFont editor with the kX drivers?</i></p>
<p>A. The current kX driver version provides support for the Vienna SoundFont editor (with the exception of 'wave playback' feature).</p>
<!-- <? print '--> <a href="#top"><img align=right src=images/top.gif alt="Top" width="17" height="8"></a> <!--'; ?> -->

<p><i>Q. Why can't I load large SoundFonts?</i></p>
<p>A. This is caused by Windows memory management restrictions. Try tweaking the following register keys (for Windows 2000 and Windows XP only):
<pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\
PagedPoolSize
NonPagedPoolSize
NonPagedPoolQuota
PagedPoolQuota</pre>
Please search our forum and Microsoft Knowledge Base for details.<br>
Setting PagedPoolSize to 0xffffffff may solve the issue.

<p><i>Q: My MIDI playback is crackling no matter what
SoundFont I use - what should I do? I have VIA chipset and AMD processor.</i></p>
<p>A: If you are using any cooling software like VCool, CPUCool, CPUIdle, etc
you need to disable it(in VCool you need to disable
NB Cool Bit, in CPUIdle disable 'AMD hardware-specific' options).

<p><i>Q: Why is there no 'Wave 2/3' device?</i></p>
<p>A: 'Wave 0/1', 'Wave 4/5', 'Wave 6/7', 'Wave 8/9' are the only wave devices available for
WinMM / DirectSound applications. They are routed to the corresponding FxBusses, that is,
'Wave 0/1' is routed to 'stereo' mix which goes to 'front' output by default,
'Wave 4/5' is routed to front only,
'Wave 6/7' is routed to rear only,
'Wave 8/9' is routed to center and subwoofer.<br>

<p><i>Q: Why is my CT4830/SB0090/SB0220 recognized as CT4832/SB0092/SB0222?? Does this affect sound quality?</i></p>
<p>A: 

The CT4830 and CT4832 are almost identical cards with different PCI IDs (as programmed into 
the onboard EEPROM). A CT4832 card is generally an OEM version of the CT4830, although 
both cards might be marked as 'CT4830'. Neither kX Audio driver performance nor sound quality 
are affected by the way in which these cards are recognized by kX (the 
same applies to SB0090/SB0092 and SB0220/SB0222 cards).

<p><i>Q: Does kX support ASIO 2 Direct Monitoring?</i></p>
<p>A:
When this option in the Audio System Setup dialog is activated, monitoring is handled by the 
actual audio hardware, that is, the monitored signal does not pass through Cubase VST. 
Instead, the ASIO driver for the audio hardware is instructed to send the audio from the 
monitored input directly back to a specified output, thus providing monitoring with 
practically no latency, 
i.e. ASIO2 Direct Monitoring simply provides zero latency monitoring of inputs. However, 
zero latency monitoring is already provided by kX ("direct monitoring" is enabled when 
you unmute an input on the kX Mixer's "Ins'n'Outs" page), so there is no reason to tax 
your CPU with ASIO2 direct Monitoring. Contrary to what many people believe, ASIO 
direct monitoring does not allow monitoring of the incoming signal with VST effects; it 
only provides monitoring of the dry input signal. In other words, this means that the 
only thing missing without ASIO2 "direct monitoring" in kX is the lack of direct 
control from Cubase (or other ASIO host) over hardware pan/level/peakmeter for unprocessed dry 
signal, although even these can be controlled via the kX Mixer. And of course you 
can always apply VST/DirectX plug-ins to as many input channels as you want using the 
kX ASIO driver.

<p><i>Q:Why cannot kX Mixer find kxskin.kxs file, although it is in the same folder?</i></p>
<p>A: You should not try executing kX Mixer from the folder you have manually copied it to.
<strike>kX Mixer should be installed into your Windows/System32 folder by the setup application</strike>.
Do not try to install it manually - simply re-run the installation program.<br>

<p><i>Q:After installing kX Driver I cannot hear anything. Why?</i></p>
<p>A: Before you can enjoy the sound quality offered by the kX Audio driver you need to make
sure it is configured correctly. For example, Front and Rear outputs are swapped by default --
make sure you have your speakers plugged into the 'Rear' jack, or disable the
swap on the 'Master' page of the kX Mixer. If you have more than 2 speakers
(4.0/4.1 or 5.0/5.1 speaker set) - set the desired configuration in the 'Surrounder' window
(you can access it via 'Effects' submenu or by clicking the 'Surrounder' button on the main
page of the kX Mixer).<br>

<p><i>Q:Why do I hear audio feedback when using NetMeeting? How do I turn off the recording feedback?</i></p>

turn it off, open the kX Mixer, and set Wave and Synth recording levels to
the appropriate values on the 'Recording' page.<br>

<p><i>Q:Why cannot I hear any sound when using GigaStudio / GigaSampler?</i></p>
<p>A: kX Audio Driver fully supports GSIF specification. There are currently two GSIF driver sub-sets:
 VxD and WDM-based. Since kX Audio Driver is a WDM driver, it supports WDM GSIF <b>only</b>.
 Under certain circumstances, this causes certain compatibility problems with GSIF-aware applications
 (such as GigaStudio and GigaSampler), especially under Windows 9x / Millenium.
 Please upgrade your Giga application (and install any patches available from Tascam). 
 If this doesn't solve your problem, the solution is either install Windows 2000 / Windows XP or
 use the original Creative VxD drivers.<br>
